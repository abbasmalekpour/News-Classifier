This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from several newspapers and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated in the news articles.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a **web scraping** method that gets the latest news from the newspapers, and an **interactive web application** that shows the obtained results to the user.

The project consists of the following steps:

1. [Dataset Creation](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/01.Dataset-Creation)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/02.Exploratory-Data-Analysis)
3. [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/03.Feature-Engineering)
4. [Model Training](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/04.Model-Training)
5. [News Scraping](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/05.News-Scraping)
6. [App Creation](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/06.App-Creation)
7. [Annex - Installation](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/07.Annex-Installation)
8. [Annex - Deployment](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/08.Annex-Deployment)
9. [Report](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/09.Report)
10. [App Creation v2](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/10.-App-Creation-v2) (*created a new version of the application after submitting the project.)
