This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from several newspapers and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated in the news articles.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a **web scraping** method that gets the latest news from the newspapers, and an **interactive web application** that shows the obtained results to the user.

The project consists of the following steps:

1. [Dataset Creation](https://github.com/abbasmalekpour/News-Classifier/tree/master/01.Dataset-Creation)
